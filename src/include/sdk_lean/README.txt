These files were a pain to organize and to make them work.
They exact origins is a mess and largely unknown, by which I mean: where does this file come from, is this original hlsdk that was edited by rehlds or regame? It so, which one to use and which version?
Nonetheless, maybe in the future I will organize this to facilitate updating with ReHLDS and ReGameDLL.
Until then, this is virtually a black box.
